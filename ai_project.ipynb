        "# Simple Ledger Balancer\n",
        "\n",
        "## Description\n",
        "This Python script provides a simple function to verify whether debit and credit entries in a financial ledger are balanced. It calculates the sum of all debit entries and all credit entries and determines if these sums are equal. The script also includes a set of test cases to demonstrate its functionality with various scenarios (balanced, unbalanced, and empty ledgers).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "*   `check_ledger_balance` function to compare total debits and credits.\n",
        "*   Includes multiple test cases to validate the function's accuracy.\n",
        "*   Prints detailed output for each test case, showing debits, credits, totals, and balance status.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Installation\n",
        "No external libraries are required. This script uses standard Python built-in functions and data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Run\n",
        "1.  **Open in Google Colab:** If you are viewing this in a Google Colab notebook, simply run the code cell containing the `check_ledger_balance` function and its test cases.\n",
        "2.  **Local Execution:** Copy the Python code into a `.py` file (e.g., `ledger_balancer.py`) and run it from your terminal using `python ledger_balancer.py`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The script will automatically execute the defined test cases and print their results to the console.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Code Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "### `check_ledger_balance(debits, credits)` function\n",
        "*   **Purpose:** This function takes two lists, `debits` and `credits`, representing financial transactions, and checks if their sums are equal.\n",
        "*   **Parameters:**\n",
        "    *   `debits` (list of float or int): A list containing individual debit amounts.\n",
        "    *   `credits` (list of float or int): A list containing individual credit amounts.\n",
        "*   **Process:**\n",
        "    1.  `total_debits = sum(debits)`: Calculates the sum of all elements in the `debits` list.\n",
        "    2.  `total_credits = sum(credits)`: Calculates the sum of all elements in the `credits` list.\n",
        "    3.  `is_balanced = (total_debits == total_credits)`: Compares the two sums. If they are equal, `is_balanced` will be `True`; otherwise, it will be `False`.\n",
        "*   **Returns:** A tuple containing:\n",
        "    *   `bool`: `True` if balanced, `False` otherwise.\n",
        "    *   `float`: The total sum of debit entries.\n",
        "    *   `float`: The total sum of credit entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Test Cases\n",
        "The script includes several test cases (`Test Case 1` through `Test Case 5`) to cover different scenarios:\n",
        "*   **Balanced Ledger:** Debits and credits sum up to the same amount.\n",
        "*   **Unbalanced Ledger (Debits > Credits):** Total debits are greater than total credits.\n",
        "*   **Unbalanced Ledger (Credits > Debits):** Total credits are greater than total debits.\n",
        "*   **Empty Entries:** Both debit and credit lists are empty (expected to be balanced as both sums are 0).\n",
        "*   **Complex Scenario:** More realistic numbers for both debits and credits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each test case calls `check_ledger_balance` with specific inputs and then prints the inputs, calculated totals, and the `Is Balanced` status. `assert` statements are used to programmatically verify the correctness of the function's output against expected results.\n",
        "\n",
